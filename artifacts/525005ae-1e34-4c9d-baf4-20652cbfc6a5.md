# Product Requirements Artifact

**Product Requirements for Real-Time Tracking and Fare Estimation Feature**

1. **Real-Time Tracking**
   - **Functionality**: The app must provide real-time GPS tracking of the auto-rickshaw during a ride.
   - **Update Frequency**: Location updates should be every 5 seconds to maintain accuracy without excessive battery usage.
   - **Driver and Passenger Visibility**: Both drivers and passengers should be able to view their respective locations on a map within the app.
   - **Geofencing**: Implement geofencing to provide alerts when entering or leaving designated zones, such as restricted areas or high-demand zones.

2. **Fare Estimation**
   - **Estimation Algorithm**: Develop an algorithm that calculates fare based on estimated distance, anticipated traffic conditions, and any applicable surcharges (e.g., peak hours).
   - **Traffic Data Integration**: Integrate a reliable traffic data API to factor in real-time traffic conditions affecting the estimated time of arrival (ETA) and fare.
   - **Transparency**: Clearly display fare estimation components (base fare, per km charge, traffic surcharge) to ensure transparency for users.
   - **Fare Comparison**: Provide a "compare fares" feature if the user opts for different routes/traffic conditions.

3. **User Interface Design**
   - **Map Interface**: Design a clear, user-friendly map interface showing real-time tracking, route, and estimated fare.
   - **Notification System**: Implement push notifications to inform users of ride status changes, price updates, and traffic alerts.
   - **Feedback Loop**: Allow users to rate rides, submit feedback, and report any discrepancies in fare or tracking. 

4. **Safety Features**
   - **Emergency Button**: Include an SOS button for users to alert local authorities or emergency contacts in case of distress.
   - **Driver Verification**: All drivers must undergo thorough verification processes, and their details should be visible to users.

5. **Scalability and Future Integration**
   - Ensure the architecture can support scaling to cabs and bike taxis in future updates.
   - Design APIs that can accommodate additional services or changes to the fare estimation algorithm as new types of vehicles are integrated.

6. **Testing and Compliance**
   - Conduct extensive field testing in tier-2 and tier-3 cities before launch.
   - Ensure compliance with local regulations regarding ride-hailing services.
